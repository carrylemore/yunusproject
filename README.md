Hi, It's mine mini project. 
This C# program prompts the user to enter the size of an array and then inputs the elements of the array. It calculates the smallest value in the array using the Min method from the System.Linq namespace. Additionally, the program creates instances of different employee types—Developer, Manager, and Admin—and calculates their bonuses based on their salaries. The CalculateBonus method is abstract in the Employee class and is overridden in each derived class to calculate the bonus according to specific rules.
